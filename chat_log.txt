Congratulations!  You are now in the second step of the selection process. The purpose of 
this step is to validate that your skills match some of our needs. For this purpose, below 
you will find a small task that should not take a long time to complete.  
 
Task: Retrieval Augmented Generation  
 
Given a paper with information that has never been seen by a large language model (LLM), 
we aim to incorporate this new information into the LLM. One method to achieve this is 
through retrieval augmented generation. In this approach, crucial data from the paper is 
provided to the LLM, enabling it to reason and respond based on that information. 
Typically, the paper and the user's query are encoded into vector embeddings.   
 
Tasks to Complete:  
1. Using the REST protocol, develop a chatbot that can accurately and truthfully answer 
queries related to the paper titled "Llama 2: Open Foundation and Fine -Tuned Chat 
Models" by MetaAI.  
 
2. Monitor and measure the latency of the chatbot's responses. We suggest using a 
language model running on CPU (libraries such as llama.cpp or ctranslate2 are of great 
help) 
 
3. Store the chatbot's responses in a database. This will allow for the retrieval of previous 
responses, eliminating the need to use global variables for this purpose.  
 
4. Experiment with various strategies for segmenting the paper into text chunks.
